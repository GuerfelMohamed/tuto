building mobile applications. This enables rapid development of
Android, iOS, and Windows Mobile apps with the same APIs and
programming style as for a regular client-server Web application. In
fact, one single codebase can be used to produce all these
applications simultaneously.
</p><p>The easiest way to get started with Ocsigen-based mobile development
is to use <a href="/ocsigen-start.html" class="ocsimore_phrasing_link">Ocsigen-start</a>.  Ocsigen-start is a
library and skeleton for building &quot;minimum viable product&quot; Web
applications with standard functionality like users, notifications,
etc. This skeleton is immediately usable as a mobile application. You
can install <span class="teletype">ocsigen-start</span> via OPAM
( <span class="teletype">opam install ocsigen-start</span> )
and instantiate its template with the command
<span class="teletype">eliom-distillery -name ocsimobile -template os.pgocaml</span>.  For
launching the mobile application, follow the instructions in the
template's <span class="teletype">README.md</span>.
</p><h2> Programming style</h2><p>You need to follow a certain programming style for your Eliom code to
work flawlessly inside an Ocsigen-start mobile app. This style is
described in the <a href="/eliom/manual/clientserver-services.html" class="ocsimore_phrasing_link">chapter on
client services</a> from the Eliom manual. The idea is that you
implement as much of your application as possible in shared sections
(<span class="teletype">[%%shared ...]</span> or <span class="teletype">let%shared ... = ...</span>), and that you
register handlers for your Eliom services on both the client and the
server. The Ocsigen-start template already uses the above programming
style, so refer to the files generated by <span class="teletype">eliom-distillery</span> for
inspiration.
</p><h2> Going further</h2><ul><li> <a href="/ocsigen-toolkit.html" class="ocsimore_phrasing_link">Ocsigen-toolkit</a> provides a set of user
interface widgets that are particularly useful for mobile applications.
</li></ul><ul><li> Danny Willems provides a comprehensive set of
<a href="https://github.com/dannywillems/ocaml-cordova-plugin-list" class="ocsimore_phrasing_link">OCaml
bindings to Cordova plugins</a>. These can readily be used for your
Eliom mobile application.
